function [indices,channels] = getSelectedIndices(selected_gates, gates)
% GETSELECTEDINDICES Gets the indices of the selected gates, and combines all channels of selected gates and displays the common among them in the listbox.
%When an individual sample is selected, it only displays those that have
%data(or non-zeros) and don't display neighbour columns
