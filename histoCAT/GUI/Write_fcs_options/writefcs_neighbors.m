% WRITEFCS_NEIGHBORS: Write out fcs-file of the neighbors of a certain cell
% population to be imported later.
%
% Input:
% fileneighb --> user-defined file name with fcs ending
% pathneighb --> path to custom gates folder, which is where the fcs-file
% will be saved
% data_neighbrfile --> matrix of merged single-cell data of multiple gates
% max_varnames --> Channel names of selected gate with the largest amount
% of channels
%
% Output:
% filename_ngate --> full file path to fcs-file that has been written
