% GETIMAGEIDS_OF_SELECTEDGATES: Extract the imageids, gate names and
% indices of the selected gates.
%
% Input:
% Sample_Set_arranged --> all samples loaded into the current session (Even if 
% a sample was removed from the listbox, this will still retain the information 
% and will only be deleted when session is closed.)
% selected_gates --> current selection of gates by user
% allids --> the HashIDs of all samples (All imageIDs irrespective of whether 
% they contain single-cell information or not are saved into allids.)
% Output:
% imageids --> the HashIDs corresponding to the currently selected gates
% gate_names_pre --> all names of the samples corresponding to the imageids
% SGsof_imageids_open  --> the indices of the selected gates in the samples listbox
% sample_orderIDX --> the indices of the selected gates in the whole SampleSet (This index corresponds to the order in which all singlecell info,
% masks and tiffs are stored.)
