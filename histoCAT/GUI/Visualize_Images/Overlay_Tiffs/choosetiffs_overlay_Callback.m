% CHOOSETIFFS_OVERLAY_CALLBACK: This function is called when any of the visualize 
% options (excpet for gating) are selected. It takes the selected gates and 
% the selected channels and finds them in the entire SampleSet (which contains 
% all samples loaded in the current session). This SampleSet is only erased when
% the user closes the session.
%
% hObject: handle to figure (see GCBO)
% eventdata: reserved - to be defined in a future version of MATLAB
% handles: structure with handles and user data (see GUIDATA)
