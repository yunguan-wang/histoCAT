% PERCENTILE_CUTOFF_TSNE: Function to cut off certain percentile of intensities for
% plotScatter_Channels color overlay. Sets intensities above the cut-off down to the
% value of the cut-off.
%
% Input: 
% vColor --> color intensities before cut-off
% handles --> structure with handles and user data (see GUIDATA)
% percent --> percentage to cut off set by slider (if slider is set to 1, the
% values above the 99th percentile will be set down to the value of the
% 99th percentile)
%
% Output: vColor --> color intensities after cut-off
