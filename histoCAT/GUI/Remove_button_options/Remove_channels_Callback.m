function Remove_channels_Callback
% REMOVE_CHANNELS_CALLBACK: For the selected gates the selected channels will be
% removed ONLY if they are costum made. If the user selects any of the
% original sample channels and wants to delete them, he will be told that
% this is not possible, since it would destroy the session.
