% Pad image to reduce border artifact. Note that comment in original
% IdentifyPrimLoG2 says "to fix border artifact". However this is not fully
% true as TS/NB observed when looking at xy distribution of spot centroids.
% There still is a bias in spot detection against the pixels at the very
% border, potentially because 'replicate' pixels are not Gaussian. Raj et
% al. 2009 did not use padding. In most scenarios, cells directly at the 
% border (and thus the pixels next to the image border) are discarded
